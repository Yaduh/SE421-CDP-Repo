Strategy Design Pattern

A1               
A2  --------I   <------- C1  
A3                       C2
problem: with every new implementation of a sort 
algorithm, we need to add a new a line and modify 
the factory class
we want to give freedom to the caller to pick
their desired implementation.

Solution: make it tightly coupled using Strategy

C1 and C2 know A1,A2,A3

Result: if we add a new class A4
we dont need to refactor the Strategy class
