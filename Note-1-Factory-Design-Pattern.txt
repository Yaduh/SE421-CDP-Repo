- Factory Design Pattern

- Dependency Injection



-------------
Polymorphism:

Class <--- Hot spot

Class A -------> Class B -----> I    A knows a lot of classes
        ------> C       
        ------D       
        ------>N        
        classes B to M are all implementations of an Interface
        A knows every single implementation of I where I is either a super class or an Interface

    We want to reduce having these hot spots as much as possible.
