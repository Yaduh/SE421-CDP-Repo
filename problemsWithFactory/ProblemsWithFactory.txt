The basic promise of factory classes is to isolate
a set of components to ensure loosely coupledness
between the callers from the implementation.

A1               Factory
A2  --------I   <------- C1(caller/user)  
A3                       C2   

so whats the key problem with factory classes?

1.  For each interface you need to add a factory classes
    which is typically shallow.
2.  if you make a project where you have a factory equivalent
    for every single 'new' keyword..
    Your project is going to be way over engineered.

Cases where factory doesnt make sense:

    -  representing every keyword 'new' with a factory class
    regardless of the type of class.

        - Classes represent data types
        
        Doesn't make sense for:
        ----------> dataType/Domain Objects
                    ex: Student, Course, ...

                    why?
                    because every data type would have its own
                    1- class
                    2- interface (shallow)
                    3- with a factory (shallow)
                    Even with that loosely coupledness you arent making your code any better
                    you're over engineering it.

        Acceptable for:
        ----------> Services
                    perform computation to the caller
                    ex: Talking to a database, storing data in a file
                        input handler, output handler, ...

        In this iteration of the code, ArraySortServiceFactory becomes a hotspot.

            A1               
            A2  --------I   <------- C1  
            A3                       C2
            problem: with every new implementation of a sort 
            algorithm, we need to add a new a line and modify 
            the factory class

            If caller has the ability to choose an implementation...
            Factory isn't ideal.

            If caller doesnt have the ability to choose that implementation...
            Factory is Acceptable.
